# Redis Sniffer v1.1.1

## About

This tool will monitor a specific port and interface for redis traffic and captures the commands being sent to Redis and/or formatted full TCP dump data.  This can be used for analysis for debugging or for replaying the transactions as a way of doing real load/performance testing.
